## Iterative statistics

In this repository, we implement the following statistics:
- Mean (see examples [here](./tests/unit/test_IterativeMean.py))
- Variance (see examples [here](./tests/unit/test_IterativeVariance.py))
- Higher-order moments, skewness and kurtosis (see examples [here](./tests/unit/test_IterativeMoments.py))
- Extrema (see examples [here](./tests/unit/test_IterativeExtrema.py))
- Covariance (see examples [here](./tests/unit/test_IterativeCovariance.py))
- Threshold (see examples [here](tests/unit/test_IterativeThreshold.py)) (count the number of threshold exceedances).
- Quantile (see examples [here](tests/unit/test_IterativeQuantile.py)): this statistics is still a work in progress and must be use with care!
- Sobol indices


*About the Iterative higher-order moments* The iterative higher order moments are available as `IterativeMoments` and permit a user to compute higher-order moments up to the 4th order (including skewness and kurtosis). The implementation follows [[5]](#5),

!!! danger "Beware of 4th order"
    The 4th order (kurtosis) does not pass our tests comparing to Scipy non-iterative Kurtosis calculations. While this is something to beware of, we also test the popular library OpenTurns, which also fails to pass the same test and uses the same equation as us. Follow discussion [here](https://github.com/openturns/openturns/issues/2345).

*About the quantiles*: Following [[4]](#4), we implements the Robbins-Monro (RM) algorithm for quantile estimation. The tuning parameters of this algorithm have been studied (through intensive numerical tests). In the implemented algorithm, the final number of iterations (i.e., the number of runs of the computer model) N is a priori fixed, which is a classical way of dealing with uncertainty quantization problems.

*About the Sobol indices*:
It also contains more advanced statistics: the Sobol indices. For each method (Martinez, Saltelli and Jansen), the first order indices, computed iteratively, as well as the total orders are available. We also include the second order for the Martinez and Jansen methods (the second order for the Saltelli method is still a work in progress).
- Pearson coefficient (Martinez): examples are available [here](tests/unit/sensitivity/test_IterativeSensitivityMartinez.py).
- Jansen method: examples are available [here](tests/unit/sensitivity/test_IterativeSensitivityJansen.py).
- Saltelli method: examples are available [here](tests/unit/sensitivity/test_IterativeSensitivityJansen.py).

NB: This package contains also useful methods for performing iterative statistics computations such as shift averaging and shift dot product computation:
- Shifted dot product (see example [here](./tests/unit/test_IterativeDotProduct.py))
- Shifted mean (see example [here](./tests/unit/test_IterativeMean.py))

### Fault-Tolerance 
For each statistics class, we implement a **save_state()** and **load_from_state()** methods to respectively save the current state and create a new object of type IterativeStatistics from a state object (a python dictionary).

These methods can be used as follows (as example):
```python
iterativeMean = IterativeMean(dim=1, state=state)

# ... Do some computations

# Save the current state
state_obj = iterativeMean.save_state() 

# Reload an IterativeMean object of state state_obj
iterativeMean_reload = IterativeMean(dim=1, state=state_obj)
```

NB: the methods **save_state()** and  **load_from_state()** are not available yet for the quantile and Saltelli Sobol indices. This is still a work in progress.

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use **iterative-stats** to compute Sobol index iteratively.

```python
from iterative_stats.sensitivity.sensitivity_martinez import IterativeSensitivityMartinez as IterativeSensitivityMethod
dim = 10 #field size
nb_parms = 3 #number of parameters
second_order = True # a boolean to compute the second order or not

# Create an instance of the object IterativeSensitivityMethod
sensitivity_instance = IterativeSensitivityMethod(dim = dim, nb_parms = nb_parms, second_order = second_order)

# Generate an experimental design
from tests.mock.uniform_3d import Uniform3D
input_sample_generator = Uniform3D(nb_parms = nb_parms, nb_sim = nb_sim, second_order=second_order).generator()

# Load a function (here ishigami function)
from tests.mock.ishigami import ishigami
while True :
    try :
        # Generate the next sample
        input_sample = next(input_sample_generator)
        # Apply ishigami function
        output_sample = np.apply_along_axis(ishigami, 1,input_sample)
        # Update the sensitivity instance
        sensitivity_instance.increment(output_sample) 
    except StopIteration :
        break

first_order = sensitivity_instance.getFirstOrderIndices()
print(f" First Order Sobol indices (Martinez method): {first_order}")

total_order = sensitivity_instance.getFirstOrderIndices()
print(f" Total Order Sobol indices (Martinez method): {first_order}")

second_order = sensitivity_instance.getFirstOrderIndices()
print(f" Second Order Sobol indices (Martinez method): {first_order}")
```

NB: The computation of Sobol Indices requires the preparation of a specific experimental design based on the pick-freeze method (see [[1]](#1) for details). This method has been implemented into the class [**AbstractExperiment**](experimental_design/experiment.py) and some examples can be found [here](tests/unit/experimental_design/test_experiments.py).
